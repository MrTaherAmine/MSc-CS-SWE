## ðŸ”¹ Section 1: General Awareness  

### ðŸ“Œ Web Development Basics  
Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that run on browsers and serve users via the internet. It is essential because the web is the backbone of digital interaction today: from personal blogs to global platforms, web development powers how users experience and interact with information, services, and systems online.

### ðŸ“Œ HTML Knowledge  
Yes, Iâ€™ve worked with HTML. HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Itâ€™s the foundational language used to structure content on the web â€” defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and form inputs. Without HTML, a web page wouldnâ€™t exist.

## ðŸ”¹ Section 2: Familiarity with CSS  

### ðŸ“Œ CSS Understanding  
Yes, Iâ€™m familiar with CSS.  **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements: colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, responsiveness, and overall visual design. CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation, allowing more control and consistency across web pages.

## ðŸ”¹ Section 3: JavaScript and Its Importance  

### ðŸ“Œ Introduction to JavaScript  
Yes, Iâ€™ve used JavaScript.  JavaScript is a **scripting language** used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. While HTML and CSS create static content and design, JavaScript allows user interaction â€” like form validation, content updates without reloading, animations, and API communication. Itâ€™s essential for building modern, responsive web applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Section 4: Introduction to React and Node.js  

### ðŸ“Œ React and Node.js Awareness  
Yes, Iâ€™m familiar with both.  
- **React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook, used for building fast, component-based **user interfaces** (UI), especially for single-page applications (SPAs).  
- **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to be used on the server side. Itâ€™s commonly used to build backends, APIs, and full-stack applications.

React handles the frontend, and Node.js powers the backend â€” together, theyâ€™re a powerful stack for modern web apps.

## ðŸ”¹ Section 5: Bonus Question â€“ Learning Intentions  

### ðŸ“Œ Why I Want to Learn Web Development  
I started my tech journey in programming and web development, then specialized in cybersecurity for over 15 years. Now, I want to reconnect with my software roots and modernize my development skills.

By mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, I aim to:
- Build full-stack, secure, scalable applications  
- Combine development and cybersecurity to lead secure software initiatives  
- Mentor others and innovate in tech with hands-on, full-stack capabilities  

This MSc is not just academic â€” itâ€™s part of my lifelong learning journey and a personal challenge to sharpen my coding edge again.
